*** prerequisities ***

# have java installed
# have ant + ant contrib installed
# have inscape installed
# update relevant paths in build.properties


*** how to run ant ***
to run all tests and validations, e.g.:
	c:\java\apache-ant-1.8.0\bin\ant
to run a set of test:
	c:\java\apache-ant-1.8.0\bin\ant testMsgr
	
* Targets to run:
testOsgr, testMsgr, testXygr
testAll - run previous three
validateAll


6. open the comparison.html file generated to visually compare the old and new pictures


The testing framework can be used also for developping.
To calculate only one or few files (faster) change the defalut filter values in build.properties, e.g.:
batchTransform.filter=t_time.*\.xml
createComparison.filter=t_time.*\.svg


*** automatic transformation of svg to png ***
# set build.properties, e.g.:
generatePng.inkscape=c:/Program Files/Inkscape/inkscape.exe
generatePng.dir=c:/Temp/__testG2S/_examples/

# run ant for target generatePng:
c:\java\apache-ant-1.8.0\bin\ant genereatePng

#
the ant script will recursively go through all directories in a given file and 
every file with .svg extension will transform to .png (to the same directory).
