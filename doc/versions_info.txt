TODO - shortTerm
    * finish times and dates 
    	- document
    * check/finish/clean up the testing tools
    	- release goal
    	- add tasks to run tests also without DTDs (testAllWithoutDtds: comment all DTD definitions, testAll, uncomment)
    * more doc:
    	- try using the project WIKI 
    	- improve documentation for test utilities
    	- schema documentation
    * fix 3D bar with negative values (e.g. t_sizes_* msgr testing files)

    
TODO
    * label rotation for x axis in xygr
    * move the label position up depending on the angle
    * gradients in 3Dpie
    * better layout when long names
    * new attributes in msgr: name of axes, labelIn/Out...
    * dates supporting rounding to whole months / years (?? weeks, year quarters)
    * improve columns: shadows, correct cylinders, cone
    * allow line breaks in the title
    * try to combine with elements from other name spaces (e.g. MathML)
	* consider colours like: title colour, background colour, axis colours
	* consider adding version number to: 
	     - script (check and report difference)
	     - XMLs (optional or mandatory attribute)
	     - schema (relax NG)
