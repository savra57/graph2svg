* new dateTime axisType
	- works on xygr, msgr, osgr
	- not very compatible with sum and stacked msgr graphs
* axisType auto will decide only between shifted and with zero, no auto-detection of log nor dateTime

NEW ATTRIBUTES 

*** xAxisLabelsFormat / yAxisLabelsFormat
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - allows customise format pattern for axes labels 
 - currently works only for dates and numbers
 - for osgr and msgr graphs applicable only on y axis

when axisType=dateTime
 - for examples see: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#date-time-examples
 - in general the value of xAxisLabelsFormat / yAxisLabelsFormat follows the template:
      <picture>~<language>~<calendar>~<country>
   where all the parts are send to the function format-dateTime as described on the page referred above.
   The language, calendar and country parts are optional.
   Note that due to the fact the "~" is used as delimiter the pattern cannot contain it. 
 - if empty an automatic pattern is used (as the picture part):
 	- if step is in days: [Y0001]-[M01]-[D01]
 	- if step is in hours: [D01]. [H01]:[m01]
 	- if step is in minutes: [H01]:[m01] 
 	- if step is in seconds: [m01]:[s01]
 - the argument is ignored if the axisType is not dateTime

when axisType is a normal number, i.e.: auto, shifted or withZero (not log)
 - see: http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/func_formatnumber.asp
 - default is '0.##############'
 - for msgr graph with stacked="percentage" the default pattern is ' #0%'
 - Note that the format-number function behave differently in saxon8 and saxon9. 
   For example if using pattern '#.##' numbers 0 or 0.125 in saxon8 would be formatted 
   to "0" or "0.13", but in saxon9 to "" or ".13"!

examples:
yAxisLabelsFormat="0.000"


*** xAxisMin / xAxisMax / yAxisMin / yAxisMax
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - allow to overwrite the automatically calculated maximum and minimum
 - it is still rounded to the whole step (always up)
 - the data points will be painted regardless if they are within the dimensions specified 
 - not specified dimensions are calculated the old way
 - for osgr and msgr graphs applicable only on y axis
 - combining with msgr graphs of type stacked="percentage" is not recommended

*** xAxisStep / yAxisStep
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - for osgr and msgr graphs applicable only on y axis
 
 
*** xAxisMarkCount / yAxisMarkCount
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - for osgr and msgr graphs applicable only on y axis
 - graph2svg schemas calculate the step length automatically (unless xAxisStep or yAxisStep is specified)
 - it tries to find an optimal length and number of marks so the step length is a round number and 
   the number of marks is close to a specified number
 - the default number of marks the algorithm is trying to achieve is 11, that can be overwritten with
   xAxisMarkCount / yAxisMarkCount properties
 - for osgr and msgr graphs the attributes are applicable only on y axis

*** graphMargin
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - margin around the whole graph
 - default 15

*** titleMargin
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - margin of the title
 - default 10

*** titleFontSize
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - the title font size
 - default 18
 
*** labelAngle
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - if the algorithm decides that the x axis labels are too long they are displayed rotated
 - the labelAngle attribute allows to overwrite the rotation angle
 - default 25

*** labelFontSize
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - the axis label font size
 - for the osgr it is applied to inner or outer labels
 - default 10, 12 for osgr

*** legendMargin (15), legendPictureWd (28), legendPictureHg (20), legendLineHg (24), legendGap (5), legendFontSize (10)
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - various sizes for the legend layout
 - default value is in the brackets

*** categoryGap
elements: msgr, osgr
 - size of the gap between columns of different categories
 - default 10

*** columnWd
elements: msgr, osgr
 - column width
 - default 20 for msgr, 30 for osgr

*** xAxisMarkDist
elements: xygr
 - distance between major marks on the x axis
 - default 35
 
*** yAxisMarkDist
elements: xygr, msgr, osgr
 - distance between major marks on the y axis
 - default 25

*** curveFontSize
elements: xygr
 - size of the font for curve names (curve labels)
 - default 10
