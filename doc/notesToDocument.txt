* new dateTime axisType
	- works on xygr, msgr, osgr
	- not very compatible with sum and stacked msgr graphs
* axisType auto will decide only between shifted and with zero, no auto-detection of log nor dateTime

dateTime

yAxisLabelsFormat
 - currently works only for dates and numbers

when axisType=dateTime
 - for examples see: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#date-time-examples
 - in general the value of yAxisDateTimeFormat follows the template:
      <picture>~<language>~<calendar>~<country>
   where all the parts are send to the the function format-dateTime as described on the page refered above.
   The language, calendar and country parts are optional.
   Note that due to the fact the "~" is used as delimiter the pattern cannot contain it. 
 - if empty an automatic pattern is used (as the picture part):
 	- if step is in days: [Y0001]-[M01]-[D01]
 	- if step is in hours: [D01]. [H01]:[m01]
 	- if step is in minutes: [H01]:[m01] 
 	- if step is in seconds: [m01]:[s01]
 - the argument is ignored if the axisType is not dateTime

when axisType is a normal number, i.e.: auto, shifted or withZero (not log)
 - see: http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/func_formatnumber.asp
 - default is '#.##############'
 - for msgr graph with stacked=percentage the default pattern is ' ##%' 
 

examples:
yAxisLabelsFormat="###.000"
